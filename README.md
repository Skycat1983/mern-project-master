We had a short space of time to learn and apply the necessary skills for this project. Consequently, there was always going to be a quantity vs quality trade off, and I definitely leant toward the former. My thinking was that it was better to gain some practice and experience with a range of different techniques and then make time to tidy it up all later, than to miss the opportunity for some guided/assisted experimentation. After all, finding time to refactor will be considerably easier in a few months time than acquiriing help from a tutor in the event i get stuck, so using this window of opportunity for a feature push made a lot of sense. 

So please don't judge the mess; it won't be there forever.
